excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth fractional programming problems that involve the sum of a convex, possibly nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator and a differentiable, possibly nonconvex function in the numerator and a convex, possibly nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator in the denominator. These problems have applications in various fields. We present a framework for a full-splitting proximal subgradient algorithm with two versions: (i) a smoothing-based version (S-FSPS) that uses carefully chosen smoothing parameters and step sizes; and (ii) an adaptive version (Adaptive FSPS) which incorporates extrapolation and backtracking to ensure the nonnegativity of the merit sequence. Both versions address the difficulty of decoupling the nonsmooth composition in the numerator. We prove that S-FSPS converges sequentially to an exact lifted stationary point and that Adaptive FSPS converges to an approximate lifted stationary point under the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. Further discussions are provided on the tightness of the Adaptive FSPS convergence results and the reasoning behind aiming for an approximate lifted stationary point. We construct a series of counterexamples to demonstrate that the Adaptive FSPS algorithm may diverge when seeking exact solutions. We also developed practical versions incorporating a nonmonotone line search to enhance performance. Our theoretical findings are validated through simulations involving limited-angle CT reconstruction and the robust sharp-ratio-type minimization problem.'
